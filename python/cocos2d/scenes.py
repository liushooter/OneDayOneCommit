# For this tutorial, we will be making two scenes and switching between them
# Theoretically, we could have two scenes made of the same layer, but there would be no visual difference between them
# For that reason we need to make two scenes with different text
# As a bonus I make them different colours as well

        # For the position, I do something we haven't done before
        # We've been making the position static, but we don't exactly know the width and height of a player's window
        # Therefore, getting the virtual height and width and then just dividing them by two is a safer bet
        text.position = director._window_virtual_width / 2, director._window_virtual_height / 2

        # And lastly we add it
