# Here is how we will structure our code
# First, we will write an Audio class that is the child of SDL's Sound class
# Second we will write an Input layer that controls both the sprite and the audio
# And to spice things up, we'll add two states to the first layer: a normal and a trippy mode

# We start with the audio class, same as before

    def __init__(self, filename):

        # You should be bored seeing this same code over and over again
