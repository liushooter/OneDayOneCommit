# 1. Jump on a left click

        # Remember that our layer is an event handler
        # This means that I don't need to add any calls to functions to execute the actions on those events

    # Let's start with that jump action
    # To start I need to overload the default click function
    def on_mouse_press(self, x, y, buttons, modifiers):
        # Remember that we said we only wanted to jump on left clicks

        # Here's where that Pyglet symbol_string() function comes in handy
        # Rather than having to interpret an inconsistent code, I can simply interpret the word LEFT and RIGHT
        if symbol_string(key) == "LEFT":
            self.sprite.do(move_left)

        # Now I need to tell the layer what to do if the user inputs RIGHT
        if symbol_string(key) == "RIGHT":
            # This is a pretty awesome feature built into Cocos
            # I only wrote code for moving left, but I can use the Reverse() function instead of rewriting code
            # Reverse() simply tells Cocos to do the reverse action of whatever you pass into it.
            self.sprite.do(Reverse(move_left))


# And once again the same init code
director.init()
