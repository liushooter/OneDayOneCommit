# For this scene, we'll be using a map with a high rectangular block that we don't want the player to be able to pass

# Just as before, I start by initializing the director
director.init(width=700, height=500, autoscale=False, resizable=True)
# This is because, as stated before, many other objects depend on the director being initialized

# And, one again, we set the keyboard and scrolling managers
scroller = ScrollingManager()
keyboard = key.KeyStateHandler()

# I'll also throw in the line that pushes Cocos's handlers to the keyboard object
director.window.push_handlers(keyboard)

# We'll also load the tilemap here for clarity, as I will be using it in the class below
map_layer = load("assets/platformer_map.xml")['map0']
# I use Cocos's XML spec for this map! Check it out if you want to see how to code your own Cocos style maps


# This time we'll make an action that extends both the Action class and the new RectMapCollider
# The RectMapCollider, you guessed it, lets us collide with rectmaps (A.K.A. tilemaps)
class GameAction(Action, RectMapCollider):
    # To begin, we'll add a function for when the Action starts
    # I use the start function instead of an __init__ function because of the way the Action parent class is structured
    def start(self):
        # We simply set the velocity of the target sprite to zero
        self.target.velocity = 0, 0

        # We also tell the game that our sprite is starting on the ground
        self.on_ground = True
    def on_bump_handler(self, vx, vy):
        return (vx, vy)

    # Now once again we update this "step" function
    def step(self, dt):
        # To begin we get the delta x and delta y values by grabbing the appropriate parts of the target's velocity
        dx = self.target.velocity[0]
        dy = self.target.velocity[1]

        # Now we make the delta x value equal to the amount left or right they are telling their sprite to move
        dx = (keyboard[key.RIGHT] - keyboard[key.LEFT]) * 250 * dt
        # This is almost the same as before - once again I combine the left and right values and amplify it so it's visible

        # Here I do the opposite of that "gravity" code I wrote before
        # If the player is on the ground and they hit space...
        if self.on_ground and keyboard[key.SPACE]:
            # they jump into the air the amount that the gravity pulls down
            dy = 1500

        # What we do here may seem a bit odd, but it essentially acts as gravity for the target
        dy -= 1500 * dt
        # I subtract a number, in this case I chose 1500, from the delta y to make it come back down to the floor of the map

        # Here is all of the code for the collision of the target
        # What we do is get a "bounding rectangle", or the imaginary box around the sprite, from the last frame
        last_rect = self.target.get_rect()

        # Then we copy it into a new bounding rectangle that we can alter the values of to match what our math has done
        new_rect = last_rect.copy()

        # So we simply add our new X value to the old one (if it's moving left it will subtract instead)
        new_rect.x += dx

        # And we add our new Y value to the old one as well!
        new_rect.y += dy * dt

        # Now we need to actually check for collisions
        self.target.velocity = self.collide_map(map_layer, last_rect, new_rect, dy, dx)
        # What this line does is run the collide_map function from RectMapCollider to figure out new dx and dy values
        # Then it sets the target's velocity equal to those new dx and dy values

        # Here we check if it is on the ground by looking at the previous bounding rect's y and the current one's y
        # If they're both the same, we know that the target has not moved off the ground!
        self.on_ground = bool(new_rect.y == last_rect.y)

        # Now we need to anchor the position of the target to the middle of the bounding rectangle (or else the target won't move)
        self.target.position = new_rect.center

        # And lastly we set the focus of the scroller to the center of the player (which is the center of the rect)
        scroller.set_focus(*new_rect.center) # The * sets the argument passed in as all of the required parameters


# Now, once again, we make another class for the sprite's layer
# Remember that it must be a ScrollableLayer
class SpriteLayer(ScrollableLayer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SpriteLayer, self).__init__()

        # And, just like last time, we make our sprite and have it do the action we define
        self.sprite = Sprite("assets/img/grossini.png")
        self.add(self.sprite)
        self.sprite.do(GameAction())

# The first thing we do in our "main" code is make the layer we just defined
sprite_layer = SpriteLayer()

# Now here's some more code we haven't done before
# Essentially, we need to find the cell where I marked for the player to start, and set the sprite as starting there
# We do this by first finding that cell I marked (check the source code of the map to see how it's done)
start = map_layer.find_cells(player_start=True)[0]

# Then I get that bounded rectangle we talked about earlier from the sprite
rect = sprite_layer.sprite.get_rect()

# After that I set the middle bottom of the sprite's bounded rectangle equal to the middle bottom of the start cell
rect.midbottom = start.midbottom

# And lastly I set the position of the sprite to the center of the rectangle
sprite_layer.sprite.position = rect.center

# From here it's pretty easy sailing
# First I add the map, and set the "z" to 0
scroller.add(map_layer, z=0)
# The z is the vertical axis, so the highest z value layer will always show on top of the others

# Then I add the sprite, and set the z to 1 so that it shows on top of the map layer
scroller.add(sprite_layer, z=1)

# Then I make a ColorLayer, just to spice up the background a bit (which for now is just transparent)
bg_color = ColorLayer(52, 152, 219, 1000)

# Then I make a scene
scene = Scene()
# And I add the scroller to it and put it on top of the stack of layers
scene.add(scroller, z=1)

# And I add the background color (I don't need to define a z because by default it's 0)
scene.add(bg_color)

# And then we run it!
director.run(scene)
