# Let's make a simple game where you drive around a track in a car
# This code is a simplified version of the one that exists in the cocos examples

# The first thing I need to do is initialize the director, because many other objects in this program depend on it
# This time I'm going to pass in a few more parameters than usual into the initialize function
director.init(width=800, height=600, autoscale=False, resizable=True)
# I simply set an X and Y for the window, and allow it to be resized

# Here I set a scroller and a key manager
# The key manager is something new you haven't seen!
# It allows me to get the keys being pressed, globally (unlike event handling layers). Pretty neat!
keyboard = key.KeyStateHandler()

# And the scrolling manager like you saw last time
scroller = ScrollingManager()


# Here's something you haven't scene before!
# We'll be using the Driver class from the "move_actions" provided by Cocos, and editing it slightly for our needs
# The driver class is built to help make having sprites behave like vehicles much simpler
class CarDriver (Driver):
    # We don't need to call the init function because the Driver class already does that for us!

    # Instead I only want to overload this step function. This is what controls the movement of the sprite
    def step(self, dt):
        # This line might seem pretty complicated, but it's really not at all
        self.target.rotation += (keyboard[key.RIGHT] - keyboard[key.LEFT]) * 100 * dt
        # Essentially what I do here is take the right value minus the left value (remember that moving left is negative)
        # And then I multiply it by 100 so it's more visible, and multiply it by the dt value passed in by the step function
        # Finally, I add it to the rotation of the "target", which would be the sprite we tell to do this action

        # Now I'm going to do something very similar for the sprite's acceleration
        self.target.acceleration = (keyboard[key.UP] - keyboard[key.DOWN]) * 350
        # See if you can figure this out yourself!

        # Next I'm going to make the car stop completely if the space key is held
        if keyboard[key.SPACE]:
            self.target.speed = 0
            # Pretty easy, huh?

        # That's basically it!
        # Now we just need to call the original step function to let it do its magic
        super(CarDriver, self).step(dt)

        # Lastly, this line simply tells the ScrollingManager to set the center of the screen on the sprite
        scroller.set_focus(self.target.x, self.target.y)


# Now we need to make a layer for the car itself!
# Remember that the layer needs to be scrollable so that the car can move around the map
class CarLayer(ScrollableLayer):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CarLayer, self).__init__()

        # Here we simply make a new Sprite out of a car image I "borrowed" from cocos
        self.sprite = Sprite("assets/img/car.png")

        # We set the position (standard stuff)
        self.sprite.position = 200, 100

        # Oh no! Something new!
        # We set a maximum forward and backward speed for the car so that it doesn't fly off the map in an instant
        self.sprite.max_forward_speed = 200
        self.sprite.max_reverse_speed = -100

        # Then we add it
        self.add(self.sprite)

        # And lastly we make it do that CarDriver action we made earlier in this file (yes it was an action not a layer)
        self.sprite.do(CarDriver())

# Now to the code that actually runs this game!
# Here I make a layer out of that CarLayer we defined before
car_layer = CarLayer()

# Next I load the map of the racetrack just as I did in the last tutorial
map_layer = load("assets/road_map.tmx")["map0"]

# Then we add them to the ScrollingManager
scroller.add(map_layer)
scroller.add(car_layer)
# Order is important! If we added the car layer first, the map would go on top and you wouldn't see the car

# Then we make a scene out of the scroller (just like we did before)
scene = Scene(scroller)

# This line is a bit random here but...
# I also need to push the handlers from the window to the object from Pyglet
# If I don't, it won't be able to handle the Cocos2D keyboard input!
director.window.push_handlers(keyboard)

# And finally we run the scene
director.run(scene)
